Reviewing JavaScript

TIL: 
To passing in command line arguments to a Node.js program,
I need to use process.argv, which is an array.
The 0th is going to be the path to node on the computer.
The 1th is going to be the name of the script
2nd and on are going to be where you find the parameters to pass.
